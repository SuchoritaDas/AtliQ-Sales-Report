# AtliQ Hardware – Business Performance Intelligence Project
### (Excel, Power Query, Power Pivot, Financial & Market Reporting)
### ● Project Purpose
This project was built to give AtliQ Hardware’s leadership a clear, data-driven view of business performance across revenue, profitability, markets, and customers.
The goal was to transform raw sales and financial data from multiple years into structured, easy-to-understand performance reports that support pricing, sales, and strategic planning decisions.
All analysis was developed in Excel using Power Query and Power Pivot and delivered in PDF format so it can be shared easily with management teams.

### ● Overall Business Performance (P&L by Fiscal Year)
-- AtliQ Hardware experienced extremely fast growth over three years.

-- In 2019, the company generated ₹87.5M in net sales with a gross margin of ₹36.2M, giving a profit margin of 41.4%.

-- In 2020, revenue increased to ₹196.7M, but the profit margin dropped to 37.3%.

-- By 2021, revenue reached ₹598.9M, but margin fell further to 36.4%.

-- This means the business grew more than 6× in sales, yet became less profitable per rupee of revenue.
The company is selling far more products, but rising costs, discounts, or operational inefficiencies are reducing profitability.

### ● Market Performance and Revenue Quality (P&L by Market)

-- The market-level profit and loss report shows how different countries contribute to AtliQ’s business.

-- Some countries generate high sales but low profitability, while others generate lower sales with stronger margins.

For example, India produced ₹161.3M in revenue but only 32% margin, while Japan generated much less revenue but earned a 46.5% margin.
-- This highlights where AtliQ should:

Improve cost control and pricing

Focus expansion efforts

Protect high-margin markets

It allows leadership to move beyond just “who sells more” to “who sells profitably”.

### ● Seasonality and Sales Patterns (P&L by Month)

-- Monthly P&L analysis shows how revenue and margin behave throughout the year.

-- In 2021, revenue peaked during Q4, with December reaching around ₹78M in sales.

-- Margins remained around 36%, showing that high-sales months do not always improve profitability.

-- This view helps with:

Inventory planning

Promotion timing

Production scheduling
-- It reveals when the business is strong and when it is vulnerable.

### ● Market Performance vs Target

-- Despite record-breaking revenue of ₹598.9M in 2021, the company still missed its sales target by ₹54.9M, equal to –9.17%.
-- Large markets such as:

USA (–11.66%)

Canada (–14.45%)

UK (–8.72%)

India (–5.92%)

all failed to meet expectations.

-- This shows that growth alone is not enough.
AtliQ must improve execution, distribution, and pricing strategy in key regions to meet business goals.

### ● Customer Performance – Who Actually Drives Growth

Customer-level analysis reveals how AtliQ really makes money.

-- A small group of major partners generates most of the revenue:

Amazon generated ₹82.1M in 2021

AtliQ Exclusive generated ₹61.1M

AtliQ eStore generated ₹53.0M

Flipkart generated ₹19.3M

-- These customers also grew rapidly:

Amazon grew 218.9%

AtliQ Exclusive grew 345.8%

Flipkart grew 231%

Walmart grew 370%

-- This shows that AtliQ’s growth is highly concentrated.

-- Protecting these relationships is critical for revenue stability.

-- At the same time, many smaller retailers grew between 300% and 2000%, representing future high-potential customers if nurtured properly.

### ● How to Use These Reports
-- Leadership can use these reports to:

Track whether revenue growth is profitable

Identify underperforming countries

Focus on high-value customers

Detect margin erosion

Allocate marketing, inventory, and sales efforts more effectively

-- Together, these reports form a complete business performance system that supports strategic decision-making across finance, sales, and operations.

### ● Why This Project Matters

This project turns raw Excel data into business intelligence.
It connects sales, markets, customers, and profit into a single, understandable story.
It allows AtliQ Hardware to move from: “Here are our numbers”
to
“Here is what we should do next.”
